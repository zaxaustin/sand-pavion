# Membership Progression & Milestones

Derived from Section 4.1 of the doctrine, the Sand Pavilion tracks member development through transparent contribution bands. Each band is assessed during monthly circle reviews and referenced inside the member portal.

## Orientation (Days 0–30)
- **Responsiveness:** Reply to issues, messages, or pull requests within 72 hours.
- **Collaboration:** Shadow two reviews, practice Right Speech by paraphrasing feedback, and document one mentorship ask.
- **Outputs:** Publish an initial quest card, pledge acceptance, and onboarding checklist confirmation.

## Immersion (Months 2–4)
- **Responsiveness:** Average response time of 48 hours across assigned work.
- **Collaboration:** Co-author two retrospectives, host at least one pairing session, and log positive Right Action decisions (e.g., declining harmful project work).
- **Outputs:** Demonstrate applied learning through at least one inheritance artifact draft.

## Stewardship (Months 5+)
- **Responsiveness:** Sustain a 24-hour response window for assigned tickets and mentee requests.
- **Collaboration:** Mentor at least two members monthly, lead a consent-based decision circle, and surface conflict navigation examples rooted in Right Speech.
- **Outputs:** Maintain an updated IP ledger, prepare graduation ritual materials, and co-facilitate onboarding.

## Measuring Progress
Circle stewards capture both the quantitative metrics above and qualitative reflections on clarity of speech, generosity in collaboration, and adherence to ethical safeguards. Members who satisfy Stewardship criteria can initiate the graduation ritual outlined in Section 4 and the member portal.
