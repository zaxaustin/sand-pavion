# Member Lifecycle & KPI Framework

This guide translates Section 5 and 6 of the blueprint into practical checkpoints for stewards.

## Lifecycle Stages
1. **Invitation & Orientation**
   - Gate & Ritual circle delivers the Dharmic pledge, Right Speech guidelines, and expectations for disciplined practice.
   - Member signs CLA and onboarding pledge; profile is created in the KPI dashboard.
2. **Apprenticeship**
   - Members pair with mentors for at least one sprint cycle.
   - Required artifacts: practice log, code review participation, and contribution reflection referencing Dukkha/Samudaya insights.
3. **Stewardship**
   - Contributor leads a feature, ritual, or research stream.
   - KPIs monitored weekly; member begins mentoring newer arrivals.
4. **Cessation (Exit Readiness)**
   - KPIs show consistent quality, community leadership, and IP readiness.
   - Member files an exit proposal and participates in ceremony described on `member-portal.html`.

## Quantitative Metrics
- **Commits & LOC deltas** (tracked via repo analytics).
- **Pull Request latency** (time to first review, time to merge).
- **Issue stewardship** (opened, triaged, and closed counts).
- **Volunteer hour valuation** using Independent Sector rate ($34.79/hr for 2024).

## Qualitative Metrics
- **Skill benchmarks**: language/framework competency, product leadership, research craft.
- **Samādhi practices**: mindfulness rituals logged after retrospectives, evidence of Right Effort.
- **Mentorship participation**: hours mentored, mentee feedback, recorded learnings.
- **Cultural alignment**: peer feedback on Right Speech/Action adherence and conflict resolution contributions.

## KPI Dashboard Inputs
- Source data from GitHub stats, steward server logs, and manual ritual reports.
- Each circle updates its portion weekly; Member Lifecycle circle compiles a shared dashboard (prototype lives in `business_quest_dashboard.tsx`).
- Dashboard highlights: at-risk members (high Dukkha), ascendant members (approaching Nirodha), and alumni impact stories.

## Reporting Cadence
- **Weekly**: circle standups annotate notable KPIs and any obstacles.
- **Monthly**: Steward Board publishes a summary (mirrored in `steward-board.html`).
- **Quarterly**: AGM prep packet compiles KPI trends, volunteer hour valuations, and exit dossiers in progress.

## Exit Ritual Checklist
1. Confirm CLA and IP packet completeness.
2. Schedule cessation ceremony (virtual or in-person) recognizing the member’s Path.
3. Deliver assignment letter plus branding guidance.
4. Publish alumni profile in `member-portal.html` and archive KPIs.

Keeping these metrics visible ensures that the nonprofit’s non-monetary ROI is legible to donors, members, and future cohorts.
