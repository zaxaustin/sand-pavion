# Intellectual Property & Exit Playbook

This playbook operationalizes Section 4 of the Sand Pavilion blueprint so that every contribution, review, and mentorship moment pushes a member toward entrepreneurial liberation.

## Permissive Licensing Mandate
- **License choice**: the codebase is released under the MIT License (see `/LICENSE`). It guarantees downstream members can close their derivative work when seeking investment or commercialization.
- **Default posture**: unless a file explicitly states otherwise, all software, design assets, and documentation in this repository inherit the MIT terms.
- **Compatibility review**: when importing outside code, circles confirm the dependency’s license is compatible with MIT and log approvals in the Steward Board minutes.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
All contributors sign the CLA before merging code. The agreement:
1. **Grants rights**: contributors license their work to the nonprofit so it can maintain, sublicense, and publish under MIT.
2. **Protects contributors**: the nonprofit cannot relicense their work under copyleft terms that would block future commercialization.
3. **Defines exits**: upon meeting graduation criteria, contributors request an "Exit Dossier" containing: (a) list of authored artifacts, (b) IP provenance statement, (c) license confirmation for derivative use, and (d) brand usage limitations.
4. **Records consent**: signed CLAs are stored securely and referenced whenever a member initiates their exit.

See `docs/legal/cla-template.md` for the full language.

## Graduation / Exit Workflow
1. **Readiness review**: the Member Lifecycle circle confirms KPIs (skill benchmarks, mentorship completion, community feedback) meet the cessation threshold.
2. **Exit proposal**: member submits a short proposal describing the derivative product, namespaces involved, and any Sand Pavilion modules it will fork.
3. **IP packet**: legal stewards assemble the code provenance report plus any third-party licenses that must be preserved.
4. **Assignment letter**: the Board issues a letter affirming the member’s right to commercialize their derivative, subject to continued MIT attribution and trademark guardrails.
5. **Post-exit support**: alumni retain read access for knowledge sharing but no longer push changes to the incubating code unless they rejoin as mentors.

## Trademark & Brand Safety
- The Sand Pavilion name, crest, and logomark are trademarked. Alumni ventures may cite their lineage (“Built from the Sand Pavilion commons”) but cannot use the trademark in product names without a separate license.
- All public sites must include attribution text: “Portions derived from The Sand Pavilion (MIT Licensed).”
- Brand misuse is handled via Right Speech policy first; legal enforcement is the last resort.

## Documentation Checklist
- [ ] CLA on file for every contributor.
- [ ] License headers on executable files created via scaffolding scripts.
- [ ] Exit dossiers archived under `docs/membership/exits/` (private storage if sensitive).
- [ ] Trademark usage requests logged with the Steward Board.

Maintaining this playbook ensures that generosity (open code) and sovereignty (member-owned ventures) remain aligned.
