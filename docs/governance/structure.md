# Governance & Operating Doctrine

The Sand Pavilion’s structure combines Dharmic ethics, a Worker Self-Directed Nonprofit (WSDNP) charter, and sociocratic execution. This document translates the blueprint narrative into day-to-day policies for guild leads and incoming members.

## Dharmic Operating System

| Noble Truth | Operational Expression |
| --- | --- |
| **Dukkha – Dissatisfaction** | We treat skill-gaps and professional insecurity as the suffering our work must relieve. All project briefs begin by naming the gap a member is facing. |
| **Samudaya – Origin** | We coach members to release craving for prestige or compensation that has no developmental plan behind it. Every circle meeting starts with a check-in on learning objectives, not status vanity. |
| **Nirodha – Cessation** | "Cessation" means a member has attained self-sufficiency. Circles track who is nearing exit readiness and line up legal/mentorship handoffs early. |
| **Magga – Path** | The Path is codified through onboarding checklists, mentorship ladders, and the KPI dashboard. Each rite of passage is tied to Eightfold Path policies below. |

The Eightfold Path provides the code-of-conduct pillars. Every contributor acknowledges these before pushing code:

- **Right View & Right Resolve (Wisdom)**: onboarding requires a written pledge that the member understands the Dukkha they are solving and agrees to treat their tenure as disciplined professional training.
- **Right Speech, Action, Livelihood (Ethics)**: all channels enforce moderation guidelines that block divisive language and forbid harmful industries. The Steward Board vets new initiatives for alignment with Dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi before resourcing them.
- **Right Effort, Mindfulness, Concentration (Discipline)**: sprint rituals insist on retrospectives, pair reviews, and deliberate practice logs so effort remains focused and observable.

## Worker Self-Directed Nonprofit Stack

1. **Legal shell**: we incorporate as a nonprofit whose charter states that all revenue is reinvested into training, tooling, and reserves. No profit sharing is allowed.
2. **Member authority**: workers (contributors) influence every program they touch. Circles propose budgets, run experiments, and can object through sociocratic consent processes.
3. **Mission lock**: bylaws bind us to non-compensatory value creation—skill, mentorship, and IP—so future boards cannot pivot toward speculative profit motives.
4. **Transparency**: Form 990 filings, annual reports, and conflict-of-interest statements are published inside the repository so contributors understand how stewardship decisions were made.

### Financial Rule of Thirds
- **25% Consumption**: minimal operating costs (hosting, filing fees, accessibility tooling).
- **50% Mission Investment**: curriculum, devices, research subscriptions, and software directly tied to member development.
- **25% Conservation**: reserve account documented in finance circle updates to guard against donor volatility.

## Sociocratic Mechanics

- **Annual General Meeting (AGM)**: ratifies budgets, elects the Board, and reviews KPI dashboards.
- **Board of Directors**: upholds legal compliance, ensures the Dharmic doctrine is followed, and ratifies major policy changes.
- **Operational Circles**: small, domain-focused units (Library, Companion AI, Steward Board, Member Lifecycle). Each circle owns a charter that states its aim, authority, and consent decision protocol.
- **Double-linking**: every circle elects a representative to the Board and receives a delegate from the Board to preserve feedback loops.

### Consent vs. Consensus

- **Consent definition**: a proposal moves forward unless someone articulates a concrete harm to the circle’s aim.
- **Rapid experiments**: circles emphasize "safe enough to try" pilots. Objections must cite evidence or a test that would invalidate the change.
- **Documentation**: proposals, objections, and resolutions are logged in circle notes (mirrored in `steward-board.html` for visibility).

### Conflict Resolution
1. Invite mediated dialogue grounded in Right Speech guidelines.
2. Reference written policies (charters, bylaws, CLA) for procedural clarity.
3. Escalate to a cross-circle panel if mediation fails, documenting all steps for future learning.

## Circle Map

| Circle | Scope | Linked Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gate & Rituals** | Owns visitor orientation (`index.html`, `sacred-spaces.html`). | Ritual scripts, onboarding pledge. |
| **Library Stewardship** | Manages catalog ingestion (`living-library.html`, steward server). | Catalog logs, rights reviews. |
| **Companion Artificers** | Builds local AI tooling (`local-ai-companion.html`, `local_ai_architecture.tsx`). | Privacy reviews, hardware matrices. |
| **Member Lifecycle** | Tracks KPIs, mentorship, exits (`member-portal.html`, dashboards). | KPI templates, exit dossiers. |
| **Steward Board** | Publishes missions (`steward-board.html`, `sand-pavilion-board.tsx`). | Sociocratic minutes, finance updates. |

Each circle maintains quarterly retrospectives citing the Four Noble Truths: what dissatisfaction we observed, the root causes, what cessation milestone we hit, and which path experiments we will run next.
