The Bhagavad-Gita — Chapter II: Sankhya-Yoga (Translated by Sir Edwin Arnold, 1885 — Public Domain)

Krishna:

Thou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak'st
Words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart
Mourn not for those that live, nor those that die.

Nor I, nor thou, nor any one of these,
Ever was not, nor ever will not be,
For ever and for ever afterwards.

All, that doth live, lives always! To man's frame
As there come infancy and youth and age,
So come there raisings-up and layings-down
Of other and of better life abodes.
