# The Sand Pavilion

The Sand Pavilion is a vision for a moneyless, community-tended learning commons. Every room invites people to share knowledge, rest, and collaborate without paywalls or extraction. This repository curates early prototypes of the pavilion and now links them into a coherent visitor flow so we can keep the ember of humanity glowing together.

## Current Experience

### 1. Orientation Flow
- **Landing page (`index.html`)** now guides visitors through a four-part journey: orient with learning districts, restore in Sacred Spaces, walk multi-week Inheritance Paths, and co-create with community companions.
- A new navigation bar, timeline, and featured realms section tie together existing prototypes so guests can understand where to go next.

### 2. Featured Realms
- **Sacred Spaces (`sacred-spaces.html`)** – restorative rooms and rituals that invite stillness before community work. Includes direct access to the deeper prototype in `sand-pavilion-enhanced-meditationroom.html`.
- **Inheritance Paths (`journeys.html`)** – week-by-week journeys such as *The Way of Mindful Presence* and *Desert Wisdom* derived from the interactive builder concept in `inheritance-paths.tsx`.
- **Living Library (`living-library.html`)** – a snapshot of the reimagined Library of Alexandria inspired by `spiritual_library.tsx` and `library-alexandria-map-unfinished.html`.
- **Local AI Companions (`local-ai-companion.html`)** – an accessible overview of the privacy-respecting architecture explored in `local_ai_architecture.tsx`.
- **Steward Board (`steward-board.html`)** – highlights collaborative missions, questions, and recognition drawn from `sand-pavilion-board.tsx`.

### 3. Open Learning Districts
- The original pavilion grid remains on the landing page with interactive resource previews for topics like Open Knowledge, Creative Workshop, Science Exploration, Maker Space, and Learning Communities.

## How to Explore Locally
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to start at the Pavilion entrance.
2. Follow the navigation links to visit each featured realm.
3. Prototype files in `.tsx` or additional `.html` documents capture more detailed design ideas for future iterations.

## Future Work
- Build interactive versions of the new realm pages (e.g., transform `journeys.html` into a fully editable path builder).
- Connect the Steward Board to live submission forms and integrate with Local AI companions for mission tracking.
- Expand multilingual support and accessibility cues across every room.
- Continue integrating the remaining concept files (education platform, inheritance paths builder, etc.) into the unified flow.

## Contributing
Share ideas or new rooms by opening an issue or dropping concepts into the Steward Board. Every contribution should honour the pavilion’s ethos: generosity, respect, and collective stewardship.
