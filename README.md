# Order of the Sand Pavilion

The Sand Pavilion is tended as an initiatory sect devoted to moneyless learning and mutual care. Each chamber is overseen by a guild that guards specific practices and ensures every traveler receives what they need to keep humanity’s ember bright.

## Realms of the Order
- **Outer Court — Gate of Orientation (`index.html`)**: introduces the initiation arc, sets expectations for visitors, and threads every other realm together.
- **Sanctum of Stillness — Sacred Spaces Guild (`sacred-spaces.html`)**: prepares bodies and hearts with restorative rituals and presence work before deeper study.
- **Hall of Paths — Continuance Circle (`journeys.html`)**: hosts week-by-week journeys that turn shared wisdom into lived rhythm.
- **Archivum Vitae — Living Library Guild (`living-library.html`)**: collects community-annotated texts, oral histories, and study tracks for every level.
- **Workshop of Whispering Circuits — Companion Artificers (`local-ai-companion.html`)**: documents the privacy-first AI architecture that supports every other guild.
- **Council Hearth — Steward Board (`steward-board.html`)**: publishes missions, accountability notes, and recognition so labour stays distributed.

## Path of the Visitor (Quickstart)
1. **Pledge at the Gate**: open `index.html` to receive the four-stage initiation overview and learn the etiquette of the Outer Court.
2. **Attune in the Sanctum**: travel to `sacred-spaces.html` to ground yourself through the Sacred Spaces Guild’s arrival practices.
3. **Choose a Journey**: explore `journeys.html` and pick an Inheritance Path that matches your readiness; note the cohort signals before you begin.
4. **Study and Equip**: gather study packs in `living-library.html` and request tools from the Companion Artificers via `local-ai-companion.html`.
5. **Report to the Council**: visit `steward-board.html` to log contributions, volunteer for missions, and stay aligned with communal needs.

## How to Explore Locally
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to begin at the Gate of Orientation.
2. Follow the guild navigation present on every page to move between realms.
3. Prototype files in `.tsx` or additional `.html` documents capture more detailed design ideas for future iterations.

## Future Work
- Build interactive versions of the realm pages (e.g., transform `journeys.html` into a fully editable path builder).
- Connect the Steward Board to live submission forms and integrate with Local AI companions for mission tracking.
- Expand multilingual support and accessibility cues across every room.
- Continue integrating the remaining concept files (education platform, inheritance paths builder, etc.) into the unified flow.

## Contributing
Share ideas or new rooms by opening an issue or dropping concepts into the Steward Board. Every contribution should honour the pavilion’s ethos: generosity, respect, and collective stewardship.
